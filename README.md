# Diabetes Data Analysis Project Using SQL

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing diabetes-related data using SQL 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset related to diabetes patients and derive meaningful insights that can contribute to understanding and managing the disease better.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Extraction**: The dataset was extracted from the healthcare database containing information about diabetes patients.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The data was cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Preprocessing steps included standardizing formats and handling outliers.

3. **Data Analysis**: SQL queries were used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), calculate descriptive statistics, and identify trends and correlations within the dataset.

## Repository Structure

- `sql_scripts/`: Contains SQL scripts used for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis.
- `data/`: Includes the dataset used for analysis.
- `documentation/`: Additional project documentation and resources.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the SQL scripts in your preferred SQL editor to understand the data processing steps.
3. Refer to the project documentation for more details on the analysis methodology and results.
