This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing diabetes-related data using SQL 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset related to diabetes patients and derive meaningful insights that can contribute to understanding and managing the disease better.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Extraction**: The dataset was extracted from the healthcare database containing information about diabetes patients.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The data was cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Preprocessing steps included standardizing formats and handling outliers.

3. **Data Analysis**: SQL queries were used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), calculate descriptive statistics, and identify trends and correlations within the dataset.

## Repository Structure
